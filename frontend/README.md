## EDUVerse Documentation


## Overview

EDUVerse is a pioneering on-chain publishing platform built on the EDU Chain, designed to empower creators and learners in the decentralized education ecosystem. The platform allows creators to list courses or content entries, set a mint price, and enables users to mint these listings as their own NFTs or collectibles. This initiative is a key component of the Infra Track within the broader educational framework, with a strong focus on EduFi (Education Finance) and the "Learn to Earn" model.

## Key Features

1. Course and Content Listing
* For Creators: Creators can list their educational content or courses on EDUVerse. Each listing is unique and can include comprehensive metadata such as course details, pricing, and content previews.
* Setting Mint Price: Creators have the flexibility to set a mint price for their content. This price determines the cost for users to mint the content as an NFT or collectible.
2. Minting as NFTs/Collectibles
* For Users: Learners and users can mint listed courses or content entries as their own NFTs. Once minted, these NFTs become a part of the user's digital collection, granting them ownership and access rights to the content.
* Ownership and Utility: NFT ownership may grant access to exclusive content, certification, or participation in course-related activities, adding value beyond traditional content consumption.
EduFi: Learn to Earn

The EduFi (Education Finance) model embedded within EDUVerse introduces an innovative "Learn to Earn" approach. Users who engage with educational content on the platform can earn rewards, such as EDU tokens, for their participation and achievements. This model incentivizes learning by offering tangible benefits, bridging the gap between education and financial empowerment.
OCID Integration

Open Campus ID (OCID) integration within EDUVerse ensures a seamless and secure login experience for users. OCID serves as a universal identity across the Open Campus ecosystem, allowing users to access EDUVerse and other related platforms with a single login credential. This integration simplifies the user experience, enabling learners and creators to focus on content and interaction without the need for multiple logins.
